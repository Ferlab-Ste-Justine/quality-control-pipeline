# Automated pre-push checks, mirroring everything CI does short of the full
# NXF_VER matrix: commit-message lint, nf-core CLI version pin, pre-commit
# hooks, a declared-floor version check, nf-test suite, and nf-core lint.
# Fail-fast (set -e) so the first broken step stops the script.
#
# Not covered here, left to CI: .github/workflows/nf-test.yml's NXF_VER
# matrix only ever runs the full nf-test suite under this machine's single
# installed Nextflow version (see step 6) -- it does NOT also run the full
# suite under every CI-pinned version (25.10.4, latest-everything), since
# that would mean installing/switching Nextflow versions and roughly
# tripling this script's runtime. Step 4 only smoke-checks the floor.
#
# Note on dependencies: the dry-run and lint steps need nothing but the
# tools themselves, but the real (non-dry-run) nf-test suite still spins up
# Docker containers, and its pipeline-level tests (tests/default.nf.test)
# need the S3 test dataset synced locally (data-test/ -- see CLAUDE.md's
# "Test dataset" section). This script does NOT include the ad hoc, manually
# -inspected `nextflow run` smoke tests -- see scripts/run-smoke-tests.sh for
# those.

# Usage: scripts/run-test-suite.sh
